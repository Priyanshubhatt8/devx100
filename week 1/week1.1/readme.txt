1.Pick a Category
    beginner Medium Advance

Beginner

Complete beginner (never coded)
20-25 hours/week committment
First few classes would be okay,

~3rd week is when you might feel slightly overwhelmed.

Doubt sessions from time to time
Start to create a smaller sub group of 3-5 people, do peer coding, solve each other’s
issues
Dont attempt bounties initially focus on creating a sound foundation
Dont aim for GSoc orgs until the very end, just focus on assignments and try your best to
do
hard TODOs of all assignments
Post about your progress, keep yourself accountable, try your best not to get filtered out
in the initial few weeks

Medium

Have coded in other languages/done DSA, not done MERN
15-20 hours/week
Initial classes should be okay as long as you can context switch well b/w
languages
~7th week is when things might feel slightly overwhelming. Try to break out of
beginners hell it’s a very bad place to be. It’s the lot that feels they know how
to code but cant ever find high paying jobs
Do assignments, especially hard TODOs
Focus on GSoC from 4th week onwards, start setting up projects and picking
small issues
Would urge you to post on twitter when u make an open source
contribution/do a bounty/hard todos/things that most people in the cohort are
not doing

Advance

Already know MERN okay-ish - well/ Cohort 1.0 student
0 hours/week initially, 15 later
Shouldn’t feel overwhelming
Feel free to miss live classes atleast initially will feel slow, Skim through
recorded video later
GSOC GSOC GSOC, PLEASE START CONTRIBUTING. YOU ARE VERY WELL
POSITIONED TO GET INTO GSOC THIS YEAR.
If you need extra classes on GSoC initially let me know. You will curb the outcome of
this cohort and become the person people look up to.
If you have the time, do Bounties but generally just focus on GSoc


How to get ahead/noticed

Do bounties aggressively, irrespective of if you win or not. Lot of bounties
are going to be used in the course website
Let the world know what you’re building.
Help out people before TAs
Solve open source issues that you can. Atleast setup projects locally.
Focus on GSoC projects for now
Go week by week, just focus on the current week for the next 3 months.
Dont get distracted
