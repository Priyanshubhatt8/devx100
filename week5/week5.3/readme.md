## Todo app

Hello today iam creating a simple todo application with the help of reactjs express and mongo db and iam
and that todo application have following features

- Anyone can create a todo
- Anyone user can see their existing todo
- A user can mark a todo as done

//initialize a node project
// put a package.json (Whenever we will create backend project this file is important well definately need this file this file contain lot of information that what package we are using what all scripts we have )

## Tip whenever clients give any project we should first build backend and then frontend because backend is bit difficult to build
